# ATTS-SAC
This is a little "C" program (via CodeBlocks) upon wich your company (telecom enterprise) has to destroy the enemy Verizon who is trying to hack you.
The ID is "root" and the password is "atts".

Manual (also available in the program) :

You are a part of the Security Team of ATTS Inc (subsidiary of Alphabet Inc), 
you have to protect the servers of hacking by the opponent company Verizon but you can't switch them all off. The servers have to run even during an attack to preserve the data transfer of the company because ATTS Inc works in telecommunications.

The ATTS' Servers Administration Center (SAC) is a turn based game. Your goal is to destroy all of the Verizon's servers and make ATTS Inc the biggest telecommunications company in THE WORLD!
You have 20 servers (as much as your opponent). This servers are like your lives. You can use 3 commands :
MITM : ManInTheMiddle, you hack the private network of Verizon with your computer and kill one of their servers.
OVERCPU : You allocate one of your servers to hack the Verizon's private network and you try to overheat many of their servers (max 4) but you risk to lose your server.
FIX : You fix one of your servers (even if you have all of your servers, this command add a server).
